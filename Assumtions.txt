Assumptions:
Before build and deployment of the application:
1) Install & start mongoDB and update details in unico/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml i.e. host, port and dbname.
2) Install & start ActiveMQ for connection establishment and create queue "sync.queue". Also update the brokerURL for ActiveMQ server in beans.xml

Tech-Stack:

Used Spring, CXF to implement SOAP and REST services.
ActiveMQ for JMS implementation and MongoDB for Nosql db.
Added JUnit for unit test and Mockito for mocking.
Maven for build integration.
JBoss as application server.
